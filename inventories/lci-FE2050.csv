comment,"1 kg of hydrogen recovered from coke oven gas. After benzol absorption step, gas stream is being subjected to the reforming technology, which comprises the following process units: coke oven gas reforming
system, oxygen production installation, CO conversion system and the hydrolysis of COS, desulphurization system and CO2 removal system, H2 separation system and other plant. Although not specified, the oxygen and steam requirement is assumed to come from the coking step, hence, not listed as inventory inputs. Adapted to French context. Burmistrz et al., 2016.
